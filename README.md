## Hi there, I'm Giuseppe :D


🖥️ I've been coding in Go primarily for the last 3 years  
👷 I'm completing [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) courses to be a badass backender  
📖 I'm reading CSAPP, to better understand OS's and building a miniShell in Go  
🐍 I’m learning Python atm  
🥖 I'm also learning French because my girlfriend lives in Nice
